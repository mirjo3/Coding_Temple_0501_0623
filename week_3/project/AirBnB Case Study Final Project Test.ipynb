Which hosts are the busiest and why?\n","2. How many neighborhood groups are available and which shows up the most?\n","3. Are private rooms the most popular in manhattan?\n","4. Which hosts are the busiest and based on their reviews?\n","5. Which neighorhood group has the highest average price?\n","6. Which neighborhood group has the highest total price?\n","7. Which top 5 hosts have the highest total price?\n","8. Who currently has no (zero) availability with a review count of 100 or more?\n","9. What host has the highest total of prices and where are they located?\n","10. When did Danielle from Queens last receive a review?\n","11. Which host has the most listings?\n","12. How many listings have completely open availability?\n","13. What room types have the highest review numbers?\n","14. Is there a feature you would add to this dataset? Can we create it using existing data? If so, do it and walk through why. If not, walk through why you think the existing data is complete without any additional features.\n","\n","In order to simulate a real-life situation in which you have a take-home project from a company, you will have the chance to ask me questions before you start on this project, but once started, you will be on your own. You will need to have this completed and turned in by 9am Monday morning in order to be considered completed. You are free to use any libraries, methods, and packages in order to complete your analysis\n","\n","### **Treat this like a real take-home assesment Your workflow for this project should look something like:**\n","* Import all necessary libraries for your project\n","* Create mark-down cells and write out your thoughts and pre-analysis of the question, highlighting what features you will use to figure it out and what methods you will be testing.\n","* Write out the code, with proper comments so anyone can follow along with your thought process.\n","* Create a markdown cell after, summarizing your findings and conclusions after testing your methods.\n","* Rinse and repeat until you get through the questions\n","* Include a conclusionary summary of your analysis at the end."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":153,"metadata":{"id":"yyg0ISpJaEcj"},"outputs":[{"data":{"text/html":["<div>\n","<style scoped>\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n","        vertical-align: middle;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n","        vertical-align: top;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe thead th {\n","        text-align: right;\n","    }\n","</style>\n","<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n","  <thead>\n","    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th>id</th>\n","      <th>name</th>\n","      <th>host_id</th>\n","      <th>host_name</th>\n","      <th>neighbourhood_group</th>\n","      <th>neighbourhood</th>\n","      <th>latitude</th>\n","      <th>longitude</th>\n","      <th>room_type</th>\n","      <th>price</th>\n","      <th>minimum_nights</th>\n","      <th>number_of_reviews</th>\n","      <th>last_review</th>\n","      <th>reviews_per_month</th>\n","      <th>calculated_host_listings_count</th>\n","      <th>availability_365</th>\n","    </tr>\n","  </thead>\n","  <tbody>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>0</th>\n","      <td>2539</td>\n","      <td>Clean &amp; quiet apt home by the park</td>\n","      <td>2787</td>\n","      <td>John</td>\n","      <td>Brooklyn</td>\n","      <td>Kensington</td>\n","      <td>40.64749</td>\n","      <td>-73.97237</td>\n","      <td>Private room</td>\n","      <td>149</td>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","      <td>9</td>\n","      <td>2018-10-19</td>\n","      <td>0.21</td>\n","      <td>6</td>\n","      <td>365</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>1</th>\n","      <td>2595</td>\n","      <td>Skylit Midtown Castle</td>\n","      <td>2845</td>\n","      <td>Jennifer</td>\n","      <td>Manhattan</td>\n","      <td>Midtown</td>\n","      <td>40.75362</td>\n","      <td>-73.98377</td>\n","      <td>Entire home/apt</td>\n","      <td>225</td>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","      <td>45</td>\n","      <td>2019-05-21</td>\n","      <td>0.38</td>\n","      <td>2</td>\n","      <td>355</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>2</th>\n","      <td>3647</td>\n","      <td>THE VILLAGE OF HARLEM....NEW YORK !</td>\n","      <td>4632</td>\n","      <td>Elisabeth</td>\n","      <td>Manhattan</td>\n","      <td>Harlem</td>\n","      <td>40.80902</td>\n","      <td>-73.94190</td>\n","      <td>Private room</td>\n","      <td>150</td>\n","      <td>3</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>NaN</td>\n","      <td>NaN</td>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","      <td>365</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>3</th>\n","      <td>3831</td>\n","      <td>Cozy Entire Floor of Brownstone</td>\n","      <td>4869</td>\n","      <td>LisaRoxanne</td>\n","      <td>Brooklyn</td>\n","      <td>Clinton Hill</td>\n","      <td>40.68514</td>\n","      <td>-73.95976</td>\n","      <td>Entire home/apt</td>\n","      <td>89</td>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","      <td>270</td>\n","      <td>2019-07-05</td>\n","      <td>4.64</td>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","      <td>194</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>4</th>\n","      <td>5022</td>\n","      <td>Entire Apt: Spacious Studio/Loft by central park</td>\n","      <td>7192</td>\n","      <td>Laura</td>\n","      <td>Manhattan</td>\n","      <td>East Harlem</td>\n","      <td>40.79851</td>\n","      <td>-73.94399</td>\n","      <td>Entire home/apt</td>\n","      <td>80</td>\n","      <td>10</td>\n","      <td>9</td>\n","      <td>2018-11-19</td>\n","      <td>0.10</td>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>...</th>\n","      <td>...</td>\n","      <td>...</td>\n","      <td>...</td>\n","      <td>...</td>\n","      <td>...</td>\n","      <td>...</td>\n","      <td>...</td>\n","      <td>...</td>\n","      <td>...</td>\n","      <td>...</td>\n","      <td>...</td>\n","      <td>...</td>\n","      <td>...</td>\n","      <td>...</td>\n","      <td>...</td>\n","      <td>...</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>48890</th>\n","      <td>36484665</td>\n","      <td>Charming one bedroom -
